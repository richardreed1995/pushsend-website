            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Service Agreement</h2>
            
            <p>
              When you engage our services, we will provide them in accordance with the service agreement between us. The service agreement forms part of these Terms and includes specific details about the services we will provide, including HubSpot implementation parameters, optimization criteria, and any special requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our services and will follow your reasonable instructions in relation to the services. However, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee any particular results from our HubSpot optimization activities, as outcomes depend on many factors including your business processes and market conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Your Obligations</h2>
            
            <p>
              When using our services, you must provide us with accurate and complete information about your business, your HubSpot implementation goals, and your requirements. This includes any specific criteria for optimization, your brand guidelines, and any particular requirements for marketing automation.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are responsible for reviewing and approving all HubSpot configurations and workflows before they are implemented. While we will create solutions based on your requirements and industry best practices, the final approval rests with you to ensure it meets your standards and complies with your policies.
            </p>

            <p>
              You must actively participate in the optimization process and provide feedback on our recommendations. This includes testing new workflows, reviewing performance metrics, and engaging with our team according to the agreed protocols. Failure to participate appropriately may impact the effectiveness of our services and your results.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
            
            <p>
              We process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR and EU GDPR. Our processing activities are covered in detail in our Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we process personal data on your behalf, we do so as a data processor, following your instructions and in compliance with data protection laws. We will enter into a separate Data Processing Agreement with you that sets out the details of this processing, including our respective obligations and responsibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data processed through our services. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing and are regularly reviewed and updated.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            
            <p>
              We retain all intellectual property rights in our platform, technologies, methodologies, and processes. Nothing in these Terms transfers any rights in our intellectual property to you. You may use our intellectual property only as necessary to receive the services and in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              You retain all intellectual property rights in your materials, including your brand assets, campaign content, and customer data.

            <p>

            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Fees and Payment</h2>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Confidentiality</h2>
            
            <p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Liability and Indemnity</h2>
            
            <p>
              We accept liability for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. We do not exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
            </p>

            <p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Term and Termination</h2>
            
            <p>
              Our service agreement continues for the initial term specified in it and automatically renews for successive periods of the same length unless either party gives notice of termination at least 30 days before the end of the current term.
            </p>

            <p>Either party may terminate these Terms and the service agreement immediately by giving written notice to the other party if:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">

            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Changes to These Terms</h2>
            
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time by publishing a new version on our website. We will give you at least 30 days' notice of any significant changes. Your continued use of our services after such changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter or formation.
