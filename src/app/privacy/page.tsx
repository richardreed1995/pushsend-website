            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Our GDPR Policy</h2>
            
            <p>
              We are committed to safeguarding the privacy and accuracy of the personal data of our website visitors, service users and email recipients.
            </p>

            <p>
              This policy applies where we are acting as a Controller with respect to the personal data of our website visitors, service users, email recipients and personal data collected from public sources; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this privacy policy, "We", "Us" and "Our" refer to PushSend.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any reference to a Data Subject means a natural person whose personal data is processed by us as a Data Controller, Joint Controller or as a Data Processor, in other words, you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any reference to the GDPR applies to both the UK GDPR and EU GDPR. Likewise, any reference to EU countries will also apply to the UK. This will remain the case so long as the UK is subject to an adequacy decision by the EU. Should there be a conflict between the two, the version that grants data subjects the greatest protection will apply.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
