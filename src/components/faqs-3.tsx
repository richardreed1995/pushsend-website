            question: 'Will this work for my business?',
            answer: 'We can\'t answer this without reviewing your business - that\'s part of our discovery process. We\'ll give you some honest insight into whether this could work for you. We turn down around 40% of the applications we receive to ensure we only work with businesses where we can deliver results.',

            question: 'How much work will I need to put in?',
            answer: 'Very minimal input on your side - we handle basically everything. We generate the leads and support you in closing them, putting systems in place to follow up with all leads we generate. You\'ll provide some initial information about your business and target market, then we take care of the rest. You\'ll receive regular updates and reports, but the heavy lifting is done by our team.',

            question: 'What\'s the ROI I can expect?',
            answer: 'Clients typically receive their first qualified conversations within the first couple of weeks of launch. The ROI will depend on your investment, but most businesses run a positive ROI from the first campaign we launch.',

            icon: 'message-square',
            question: 'How do you ensure your emails don\'t sound AI-generated?',
            answer: 'We use AI carefully with constrained variables - we don\'t let AI write whole emails. We write the emails ourselves and then use AI for specific bits to personalise them. Our team crafts messages that sound like they come from a real person who has done their homework.',

            id: 'item-5',
            icon: 'clock',
            question: 'How quickly can you generate leads?',
            answer: 'We typically start seeing responses within 1-2 weeks of launching a campaign. The first qualified meetings usually come in within 2-3 weeks. We optimise campaigns continuously based on performance data to improve results over time.',
        },

            id: 'item-6',
            icon: 'bar-chart',
            question: 'How much visibility will I have into this?',
            answer: 'Complete transparency. You\'ll receive weekly reports with detailed metrics including open rates, reply rates, meeting bookings, and campaign performance. You\'ll also get notifications for every email response and meeting booking in real-time.',

            id: 'item-7',
            icon: 'pound-sterling',
            question: 'What does this cost?',
            answer: 'We typically have a pilot period for working together, and then we look to implement a long-term growth strategy. Investment varies based on campaign scope and volume targets. Book a call to discuss pricing for your specific requirements.',
        },
        {
            id: 'item-8',
            icon: 'globe',
            question: 'What industries do you work with?',
            answer: 'We work with B2B companies across SaaS, professional services, financial services, technology, and consulting. The key requirement is that you have a high-value offering (typically Â£5k+ average contract value) and a clear value proposition.',
        },
        {
            id: 'item-9',
